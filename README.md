FRDButton
=========

This is a fork of the great [BButton](https://github.com/mattlawer/BButton), modified
to tone it down to use in iOS7 apps:
- less borders
- less shadows
- less inner bezel
- smaller corner radius
- much less gradients
- also got rid of bootstrap icon support (bootstrap icons are a bit too heavy for iOS7 IMO and I usually prefer to 
build my own icon font using icomoon and do it by hand).

Other than that, usage is similar to BButton.
